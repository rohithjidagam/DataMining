# DataMining
Data mining projects done during my Masters

TicTacToe.java

Implemented a tic tac toe program using artificial intelligence techniques and graph traversals.

Neural Networks

Designed a 3 layered neural network using the sigmoid function along with the back propagation algorithm,
that shifts the two-class dataset by a translational shift such that the entire dataset falls into the first quadrant,
and the model is trained on this dataset and predicted the classification accuracy of the model after 10, 100 and 1000 epochs.

Information Retreival

Implemented a boolean search engine using Boolean Retrieval Model.

Frequent Pattern Mining

Implemented a a pattern mining algorithm based on the Apriori Algorithm. This project deals with mining of frequently 
purchased items using data mining techniques.
